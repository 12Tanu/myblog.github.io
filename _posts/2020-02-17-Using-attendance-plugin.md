Adding an Attendance Activity instance

After the attendance module has been properly installed, the teacher must add Attendance as an activity to each course they wish to keep attendance for. This is done by first ensuring that you are in the edit mode and then selecting "Add an activity or resource" in a Moodle section box.

Adding an Attendance block to a course page

.Turn editing on.
.Find the block entitled "Add a block."
.In the drop-down menu in this block, select Attendance to add the Attendance block.
.As always, move the block to fit your viewing preference.

Setting Attendance categories and grading options

Now it is time to set your attendance options. Select your attendance activity and you will see a bar of options, the last of which is "Settings." Select "Settings" and you are presented with acronyms, attendance status descriptions, and grade (points) to assign. By default, the status descriptions are "Present", "Absent", "Late", and "Excused".

You may prefer to change the descriptions (for example, by changing "Late" to "Tardy"), change the way points are counted, or add new status descriptions. To do the latter, fill in the fifth line and click the Add button. Important: when you hit the Add button, any changes made to existing options that were made after the last time the Update button was used will be lost. Likewise, when you hit the Update button, any changes made to the Add after the last time the Add button was hit will be lost.

Finally, when you are done changing items on this page, be sure to click the Update button to register the changes. 

Adding sessions

Next, it is time to add sessions. To add class sections, click the Add tab (second from left) at the top of the Attendance page. Alternatively, you can click the Add button from the Attendance block (if you've installed it) to directly navigate to the page for adding sessions. If you chose "No groups", or have not defined groups, then the Session type will be forced to "Common." If you have defined groups and have chosen to use them in your course's Attendance activity, then you will have the option to create sessions for a group or all students. 

Taking attendance

When taking attendance, the column headings for attendance status are links. If you click one of these column headings, all students will have their status changed to the status you selected. Thus, if everyone is present, you can merely click the P column header to change everyone's status to "Present". If only one person is absent, you could first click P to set everyone's status to "Present", and then set the absent student's status to "Absent". 

Reports

.Select the Attendance activity of the course and session you're interested in.
.Click on the Export tab near the top.
.Change the export settings if you wish.
.From the Format pull-down menu, select the file format you'd like to export the attendance  report in.
.Click on the OK button.
.Your browser will now probably ask you to either display or save the file.
